	<h1>Tuesday</h1>

	<p>
	Allah Almighty created diseases on <strong>Tuesday.</strong>  He descended Iblees on earth on this day, created hell, appointed the angel of death on the souls of humans, Qabeel murdered Habeel, 
	Hazrat Moosa and Haroon – peace be upon Them, passed away and Hazrat Ayyoob – peace be upon Him – was put through a test through disease on this day.
