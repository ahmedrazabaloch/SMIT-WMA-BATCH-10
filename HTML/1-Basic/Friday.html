    <h1>Friday</h1>

    <p>
      Abu Huraira reported the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) as
      saying:
      <strong>The best day on which the sun has risen is Friday;</strong> on it
      <em>Adam was created.</em> on it he was made to enter Paradise, on it he
      was expelled from it. And the last hour will take place on no day other
      than Friday.
    </p>
