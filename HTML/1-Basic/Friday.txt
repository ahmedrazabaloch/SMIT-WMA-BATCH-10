	<h1>Friday</h1>
	
	<p>Abu Huraira reported the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) as saying: <strong>The best day on which the sun has risen is Friday;</strong>
	on it <em>Adam was created.</em> on it he was made to enter Paradise, on it he was expelled from it. And the last hour will take place on no day other than Friday.</p>
