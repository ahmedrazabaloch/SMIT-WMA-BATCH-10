	<h1>Monday</h1>

	<p>
	On the authority of Abu Hurairah (ra) who said, ’The Messenger of Allah (saw) took my hand and then said, <strong>”Allah, the Exalted and Glorious,</strong> created clay on Saturday and He created in them mountains on Sunday.
	<strong><em>And He created trees on Monday,</em></strong> 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	and He created the things entailing labour on Tuesday. And He created light on Wednesday, and He caused the animals to spread on Thursday. And He created Adam (as) after ‘Asr on Friday - the last creation at the last hour of the hours of Friday, i.e. between the late afternoon and the night”’. [Muslim]
